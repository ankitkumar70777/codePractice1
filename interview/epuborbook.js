/*
=== VS ==

- In javascript === is used to chekc equality more strictly than ==
- === checks form both type and value, while == checks only for value
- ex : 
    "5" == 5 //returns true
    "5" === 5 //returns false

    "5" == 5 returns true because "5" is coerced to a number before
the comparison. On the other hand, "5" === 5 returns false because
the type of "5" is a string, while 5 is a number.

coerced : Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another
